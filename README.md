Chinese language story: An bu dang che

Idiom plays an important role in Chinese language, so Chinese lessons on idiom stories are included in many online Chinese language courses.

Today, I would like to share one in this Chinese language lesson: An bu dang che.

There is a man called Yan Chu in the State of Qi. Though very talented, he does not want to be an official. He lives a carefree and pastoral life. One morning, his servant sees Yan Chu going out unhurriedly. 
"Master, where are you going?" 
"King Xuan of Qi wants to see me. I'm going to pay a visit to the palace. I'll be back in a moment." 
At noon, Yan Chu walks back at a leisurely pace.
"You're back, Master." "Master, why did you return so quickly?" 
"King Xuan chatted with me for a while. He said he wanted me to be an official by his side. He also said he wanted to give me the best horse carriage, the most glamorous clothes and the most delicious food."
"Did you accept the offer?"
"I have no interest in becoming an official. I'm not attracted to the carriage, the glamorous clothes and the delicious food he promised me. I'm content with the plain food I eat every day. Going out on foot at a leisurely pace is as good as riding a carriage." 

In Chinese language, the original meaning of the idiom "an bu dang che" coming right from this story is to walk leisurely instead of riding a carriage. It is also used to mean to prefer hardships to comfort and ease.

This is the vivid reflection of the life of ancient Chinese scholars who treat free spirit as the top priority. Remember understanding Chinese culture is an important part when you learn Chinese.
